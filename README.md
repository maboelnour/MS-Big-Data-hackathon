# MS-Big-Data-hackathon
Code related to MS-Big-Data-Hackathon(10/04/2015) held @ AU in Cairo

We worked on the candian Historical Border Wait Times, trying to predict the waiting time in the future using AzureML Stack.
This code is responsable for fetching lat/long for the  US-Canada customs offices.
Then we used the lat/long values to train our modeler, and Voil√† we won the 2nd place in the hackathon.
